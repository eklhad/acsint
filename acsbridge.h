File: acsbridge.h
Description: a layer above the acsint device driver /dev/acsint.
Acsint carries kernel events such as keystrokes and tty output
back into user space to support accessibility adapters.
You can use the character device directly if you wish,
but that's kinda like reading a block device without
a filesystem on top of it.  You could do it, but you're probably better off
using at least some of the routines in this accessibility bridge.
You can configure the keyboard, watch for events,
maintain a text buffer for each console,
manipulate the reading cursor, watch for index markers
from the synthesizer, manage a repronunciation dictionary, and much more.

There are many routines here; some operate at a low level and some
operate at a higher level.
You should read through the entire api before you start building
your application.
This file is divided into sections of related functions as follows.

Section 1: opening the acsint device.
Section 2: sounds.
Section 3: the reading buffer.
Section 4: capturing keystrokes.
Section 5: key redirection.
Section 6: passing a string to the console as tty input.
Section 7: associate a macro or speech function with a modified key.
Section 8: repronunciations.
Section 9: foreground console.
Section 10: cursor motion.
Section 11: get a chunk of text to read.
Section 12: synthesizer communications.
Section 13: synthesizer speed, volume, pitch, etc.

/*********************************************************************
Section 1: opening the acsint device.
You can't do anything until you open /dev/acsint.
This is the device driver that provides you with
keystroke events, screen memory, and a log of tty output.
Event handlers will be described later.
For now, here are the functions to open and close the device
and check for error conditions.

Although this layer implements a form of encapsulation,
there is one thing we can't hide -
the file descriptor for the open device driver.
Why?
Because any adapter will need to read from multiple devices at once,
and it should do so in a blocking manner.
At a minimum we need to watch for kernel events from the acsint system
and index markers and other feedback from the synthesizer.
Perhaps other stuff too.
Any time you have to read from more than one device simultaneously
you need to use the select(2) call,
and that requires the file descriptors for the various devices.
So let's not pretend like we can hide this one;
let's just put it in a global variable for easy access.
*********************************************************************/

extern int acs_fd; // file descriptor
extern int acs_debug; // set to 1 for acs debugging

// Returns the file descriptor, which is also stored in acs_fd.
// Also opens /dev/vcsa, so you need permission for that.
int acs_open(const char *devname);

// Free the AccessBridge, closing the associated device.
int acs_close(void);

/*********************************************************************
Get the errno or error description in case of a communications error.
This is typically a bad read or write to the device driver.
Note that most commands return -1 for an error and 0 otherwise, like Unix.
Then you can use these functions to get the error number and description.
But really, once the device opens, errors are very unlikely.
We're not talking to a disk, or some peripheral.
Just passing data to and from the kernel.
So whether you do all that error checking is up to you.
I probably won't bother.

int acs_errno(void);
const char *acs_errordesc(void);


/*********************************************************************
Section 2: sounds.
Acsint can generate various sounds
using the pc in-built toggle speaker at port 61.
this is accomplished via another module, pcclicks.ko.
You have to install that module, as well as acsint.ko.
If you don't want any pc sounds, ever, use the parameter
insmod pcclicks enabled=0
If you want to be able to create your own sounds,
but you don't want tty output or printk messages to make noises, use
insmod pcclicks fgtty=0 kmsg=0
Remember that you can set these parameters in /etc/modprobe.conf
You can also turn sounds on and off dynamically, as shown below.
*********************************************************************/

0 frequency ends the list of notes.

slightly longer tone if the feature is turned on.

so you can hear when a capability is on or off.
Of course you can also send an appropriate string to the synthesizer:
"feature x is now enabled."
It's up to you.

// or the synthesizer is not responding properly.
int acs_buzz(void);


/*********************************************************************
Section 3: the reading buffer.
The reading buffer holds the text that you are going to read.
In screen mode this is a copy of screen memory, also known as a screen snap.
In line mode this is a log of recent tty output,
the last 50K or so.
either way it is guaranteed to be current and up to date
when your keystroke handler is called.
When you hit F2, I bring the reading buffer
up to date (if necessary), and call your keystroke handler with F2,
whereupon you can commence reading, or whatever F2 does.

Characters are stored between start and end.
*start and *end are null, and there are no null characters between.
If start == end then the buffer is empty.
This is impossible in screen mode; there are always 25 rows
and 80 columns of something.  Even blank spaces.
But in line mode there may be nothing if the tty has not generated any output.

The cursor points to the text you are currently reading.
You should advance this cursor as you read along.
This is the only thing in the buffer you should change.
Everything else is treated as readonly.

If lots of tty output pushes your cursor off the back of the buffer,
it will be left as null.
Example: cat a large file.
So be sure to ehcek for null at the top of your event handler.
You may, upon this condition,
stop reading, or sound a beep, or speak a quick overflow message.

If in screen mode, v_cursor points to the visual cursor on screen.
The reding cursor is set to the visual cursor when
you switch to screen mode.

The characters in the buffer are ascii or ISO8859-1.
They leave the tty as utf8, and are converted by linux vt.c into unicode.
That's the way acsint receives them.
It then throws away everything above 256, leaving only latin-1.
Now I could, I suppose,
convert them back to utf8 and put them in the buffer that way.
Or I could store the unicode symbols in an array of integers.
Both approaches have their pros and cons.
Given that my time is limited, I am not doing either one at present.
I'm just giving you the characters that fit in a byte,
with the implicit understanding that they satisfy an iso8859 page.
This services English and many European languages,
and is compatible with many synthesizers,
so it will do for now.
But it's not a great long-term solution.

The following typedef, declaring an acsint character to be an unsigned char,
is notational convenience, and does not represent programatic flexibility.
In other words, you can't change it!
Routines like isalpha() and tolower() only work on an unsigned char,
according to your locale.
So we're stuck with it for now.

So acsint intercepts these messages and adds the text to the tty log.
There is no interface function here, it just happens automatically.
It will also invoke your more-characters handler,
if you have one; just like regular tty output.

Section 4: capturing keystrokes.
Tell acsint that you are interested in capturing a keystroke.
It will give it to you, and not to the console.
Indicate the key (on your keyboard), and the shift state.
Symbolic names for keys and states are given in acsint.h and linux/input.h -
the latter being included by the former.
So if you want to capture control r, to read the screen or whatever, do this.

acs_setkey(KEY_R, ACS_SS_CTRL);

If you are doing something with both control r and alt r:

acs_setkey(KEY_R, ACS_SS_CTRL|ACS_SS_ALT);

This captures control r, and alt r, but not alt control r.
If exactly one of the modifiers in your bitmask is active,
you get the keystroke; otherwise it goes on to the console.

ALT is shorthand for left and right alt.
You can use LALT or RALT if you only want left alt r or right alt r.

If you don't want to see any variations on r:

acs_unsetkey(KEY_R);

If you want to capture F2, you must specify plain:
this didn't come up with r, you wouldn't want to capture plain r.

acs_setkey(KEY_F2, ACS_SS_PLAIN);

To capture F2 or shift F2:

acs_setkey(KEY_F2, ACS_SS_PLAIN|ACS_SS_SHIFT);

To capture any and all variations on F2,
including control shift F2 and other chords:

acs_setkey(KEY_F2, ACS_SS_ALL);

Well you probably don't want to do this,
since alt-F2 will be captured and you won't be able to switch to console 2.

When F2 is pressed, your keyboard handler will be called with
KEY_F2, shiftstate, leds.
Leds are the settings for capslock, numlock, scrolllock.
Example ACS_LEDS_NUMLOCK if numlock is on.
See the handler below.

If you are capturing all variations of a key,
you have to use it or throw it away.
You can't give it back to the console.

If you are capturing a key from the numeric keypad,
you only get it if numlock is off.
Otherwise it is passed to the console and treated as a number.

Note, these are low level key control functions,
and you probably don't want to use them.
I include them for completeness.
You probably want to use acs_line_configure(), described in section 8.
And acs_reset_configure(), also in section 8, calls clearkeys() for you.

Events are read from the device driver at that time,
and your handlers are called.
So you want to use select to monitor all your devices,
acs_fd and synthesizer_fd etc,
and if acs_fd is ready to read, call acs_events().
That will bring in your keystroke events.
It's probably best to just remember the last keystroke event,
i.e. the last speech command issued,
and act on that, in case the user has typed ahead of the adapter.
*********************************************************************/

int acs_events(void);

/*********************************************************************
The refresh command brings the text buffer up to date.
You can call it any time, but the usual procedure
is to call it when you are ready to read the next sentence or line
from the buffer, and your more-chars handler has been called.
New text has been generated, and you want it in hand before you
continue with your reading.

Another use is automatic reading.
You are sitting quietly, waiting for something to happen.
You get the more-chars event.
Call refresh() to update the buffer, then read away.
The user automatically hears any new text that is generated.
I'm one of the few people who doesn't like this autoread feature,
but most people do, so there it is.

You do not need to call this on keystrokes;
the buffer is automatically brought up to date.
*********************************************************************/

int acs_refresh(void);


/*********************************************************************
Section 5: key redirection.
Tell the driver to redirect keystrokes in several different ways.

Bypass sends the next key through to the console,
even if it is a key that you would normally capture.
If you have bound ^C to a speech function, but you want to interrupt
a running program, issue the bypass command, and then type ^C.
It will pass through and perform its regular function.
You can also pass ^S ^Q and ^Z, which have particular meanings in Linux.
Basically anything can be sent through, even the letter t,
which would have gone through anyways.

Use the divert command to divert all future keystrokes to the adapter,
and not to the console.
This is typically used for a text search.
If you want to look for the word foo in the buffer,
then you need to type the word foo into your adapter,
not the console.
Divert makes this possible.
Typically divert is turned back off when the adapter receives the return key.
The string is entered, and we're ready to go.

Finally, monitor can be used to look at every key,
those that are captured and those that go on to the console.
You can use this feature to echo keys as they are pressed.
However, most people respond to the echo characters from the tty,
and speak them then.
Thus you know the computer has responded to the key you pressed.
You typed e, and e has appeared on the screen,
and your adapter says "e".
This is managed through the more_h handler described in section 3.
So monitor is a function that you probably won't need.

/*********************************************************************
Use the divert function to capture a string.
This is all handled internally for you.
Pass in the char buffer and its length,
and I will populate it with text entered at the keyboard.
The return key becomes null, and ends the string.
The text must consist of letters, digits, and punctuation,
i.e. the keys on the main block.
Other keys are rejected.
Use the property bits to determine whether bad keys simply beep,
or whether they abort the entry of the string.
See the property bits below for various operational options.
ACS_KS_DEFAULT is a good setting.

Escape always aborts the string, like the user saying "oh never mind."

You may provide an echo callback function to monitor each valid character
as it is typed.
This would only be used if you are in an echo mode and you want to continue
echoing characters as they are typed into the string.

acs_keystring() returns 0 if the string is fetched successfully,
or -1 if it is aborted.

While gathering the string, only /dev/acsint is queried.
If the synthesizer tries to communicate with us,
e.g. passing back index markers or "done speaking" or whatever,
it will have to wait until the string is complete.
This is usually not a problem, because reading is stopped or suspended,
or at least it should be,
while you are typing a string into the adapter.

Section 6: passing a string to the console as tty input.
an adapter typically generates input for two reasons.

1. A key can be a macro for a commonly used string,
something that you don't want to type over and over again.
for example, alt F7 is configured,
on my system, to generate the / * line that starts the top of this comment box,
while alt F8 generates the bottom.

2. As a form of cut&paste.
Mark the start and end of a string in the buffer, grab it,
then inject it into the input stream of this session or another session.
I typically cut&paste between two virtual consoles.
Cut&paste is just the greatest thing since sliced bread.

This function pushes characters onto the input stream of the current tty.
In theory you could inject up to 64K of text,
but I've only tested up to a few hundred.
Over 256 is not a problem,
so cut&paste a large block of text if you wish.

/*********************************************************************
Section 7: associate a macro or speech function with a modified key.
Bind a macro to a key or modified key.
When you hit control F2, for instance,
a certain string is sent to the console via acs_injectstring(),
as described above.

We first map the key code and shift state into a number from 0 to 480.
This gives the modified key code or mkcode.
alt V is different from control V, etc.
This code is then used to set, clear,
or retrieve the macro associated with the key.
It can also be used to set or clear a speech function bound to that key.

There is an ascii converter as follows:
^V  control V (v can be lower or upper case)
@V  alt V
l@V  left alt V, if left and right alt are treated differently
F2  function key 2
^F7  control F7
@F9  alt F9
r@F9  right alt F9
+F3  shift F3
#0  numpad 0
#.  numpad .
#*  numpad *
#/  numpad /
#-  numpad -
#+  numpad +
^#3  control numpad 3
@#5  alt numpad 5
+#8  shift numpad 8
up  up arrow
down  down arrow
left  left arrow
right  right arrow
^right  control right arrow

At this point we have described four configuration functions:

bind a macro to a modified key
bind a speech function to a modified key
set the pronunciation of a punctuation mark
set the pronunciation of a word

The acs_line_configure() function will do all of these for you.
It is designed to process a line from your config file.
Open file; while read line { acs_line_configure(line) } close
Or you can type the line in at the keyboard
and reconfigure the adapter on the fly.

A blank line, or line beginning with # is ignored.
Use ## to set the pronunciation of #

The four functions have the following syntax.

# macro begins with the modified key follow by less than.
# < is suppose to remind you of getting input, as in <filename
+F3 < this is text that should be sent to the console on shift F3

# Without the less than sign, it is assumed to be a speech function
# of your design.  I don't really care what the words are here.
f8 read next line

# two words separated by whitespace becomes a dictionary entry

# set punctuation pronunciation
}  right brace

You can provide a callback syntax checker, which is invoked for your
speech commands.
If the user types, or places in his config file,
^t garbage
your syntax checker will be called with "garbage",
and you can return -1, because that is not a recognized speech function.
-1 is passed back through, and you can report "syntax error on line 17",
which was trying to associate garbage with control t.
If the speech function is valid, you may encode it in any way you wish.
Replace "read next line" with "12", for instance.
I pass you the string as char * rather than const char *,
so you can modify it if you wish.
But make sure it is still a null terminated string,
because I will associate that string with that modified key
as its speech command.
Within your handler,
call acs_getspeechcommand(KEY_T, ACS_SS_CTRL)
and you will get the string "12".
switch on 12 and do what you are suppose to do.

What about the acsint driver itself?
If you use this function to arrange your macros and key bindings,
and only this function, keystrokes will be captured accordingly.
In other words, I call acs_setkey and acs_unsetkey as needed.

To keep things in sync, use line_configure() all the time,
even with cut&paste.

Build a line that looks like
^T<text between the two marks
and pass this to line_configure().

Section 10: cursor motion.
Every adapter has to move the reading cursor to the beginning of the line,
next line, previous line, start of word, end of word, next word, etc.
These are common functions that you shouldn't have to reinvent.

I choose to operate on a temp cursor, which is initially set
to the reading cursor, and then roams around the buffer.
If there is no next line, or previous line,
or if you are searching for foo and foo is not in your buffer,
then you can cancel the operation and your reading cursor is right
where you left it.
But if the cursor operation is successful you can set
the reading cursor to the temp cursor and off you go.
The "other" design, saving a copy of the reading cursor at the outset,
and then going back to it if the operation is not successful,
is really no harder or easier to implement.
It's 6 of one and half dozen of the other.
So I'm taking door number 1, the temp cursor approach.

The return convention here is different.
I return 1 for success and 0 for failure.
If you can move to the next line, for instance, I return 1;
but if there is no next line I return 0.
0 is always returned for an empty buffer.
There is just nothing to do.

/*********************************************************************
Section 11: get a chunk of text to read.
Starting at the reading cursor, fetch text from the buffer
and copy it into a destination array that you specify.
If you are reading a word at a time (set ACS_GS_ONEWORD),
I will fetch one word as defined above, or one punctuation mark.
This could be a space, newline, control character, etc.
But if you are reading continuously I will copy text up to the end
of the destination array, leaving room for the null byte at the end,
or to the end of the tty buffer, which ever comes first.

If you set ACS_GS_STOPLINE I will stop when I encounter a newline character.
Reading line by line can be helpfull when working on software
or other technical material.
Even if you are reading all the way down the page,
you may still want the stopline feature,
so you can keep the cursor on the correct line,
or pause between lines,
or call acs_cr() for each newline and keep these sounds
in sync with the speech.
Stopline might be off if you are reading a story,
and the punctuations tell all,
and the newlines really mean nothing.
In my world that doesn't happen very often, so stopline is usually set.

Don't use this function to read a single character.
Just grab rb->cursor[0] and go.
This routine has too much overhead for just one character,
and it does some translations (see below) that you probably don't want.

Your destination array should be big enough to hold
a reasonable phrase or sentence.
Yes, you could feed your synthesizer one word at a time,
but the speech is chopppy and unnatural.
You - probably - don't - want - to - do - that.
So make your sentence array 200 bytes or so.

Even at that we could truncate a sentence, or even a single word.
After all, the buffer could contain a string of 10,000 letters.
That is technically one word, but you wouldn't feed that to the synthesizer.
A word should be at most 20 characters.
So when you are fetching a word at a time you should set the length
to 20 or so, rather than the 200 or so that makes sense
for grabbing an entire sentence.

The first translation,
which you can turn on or off through ACS_GS_REPEAT,
is the compression of a repeated punctuation mark into one token.
-------------------- is encoded as - and the number 20.
This is indicated by the sentence preparation mark,
a character that almost never appears in real text.
I use 0x80.  See the definition of SP_MARK below.
SP_MARK SP_REPEAT - 20 SP_MARK
means there were 20 dashes.
I've seen thousands of dots in a row, for instance, when a program
uses these to indicate it is working on a task and making progress.
This translation makes it a single token that fits in a sentence.
Again, you can turn this feature on or off through ACS_GS_REPEAT.

I also compress spaces down to a single space,
and remove space from the beginning or the end of the sentence.

These are the only two translations that take place here.
Other than that you will receive the text as it appears in the buffer.

You could get an empty string if the buffer is empty,
or consists entirely of spaces and you are reading continuously.

There is of course much more translation that could be done.
$3,000 becomes 3 thousand dollars
02/03/2011 becomes February third 2 thousand eleven
3.6 becomes 3 point 6
3.4.5.6 becomes 3 dot 4 dot 5 dot 6
And so on.
These changes, that make text more readable,
will be handled in other routines.
We shouldn't try to do everything here.
So this is just the first step.

The offset array, which you provide, is optional, and can be 0.
If present it must be as long as the sentence array.
If a word or symbol begins at character 7, that is,
7 bytes past the reading cursor, I will set offset[7] = 7.
Nonzero entries in the offset array are essentially index markers,
indicating where the words and symbols begin.
These can be sent to most synthesizers to keep the reading cursor
in sync with the actual speech.
The synthesizer passes these index markers back to the adapter as it talks,
and the adapter moves the reading cursor along.
So when you interrupt speech you are on the word you last heard.
Of course each synthesizer has its own particular
format and protocol for its index markers.
I'm not trying to anticipate that here.
These are just logical markers where the words begin,
and where they are located relative to the reading cursor.

The last offset, corresponding to the null byte in the sentence array,
is the length of the text consumed, or the offset of the next chunk to read once this one is finished.

Unsigned short is sufficient to represent an offset, since the entire
tty buffer cannot be larger than 64K.
Not that you'd ever want to read a sentence that long anyways.
You'd almost think unsigned char is sufficient, a sentence of length 256,
but the sentence may include a thousand dashes, which are compressed down
to a single token, and so the word after those dashes has index 1043.
I'm going with unsigned short just to be safe.

Section 12: synthesizer communications.
Most synthesizers communicate with us over a file descriptor,
be it a serial port, socket, or pipe.
If that is the case, you can use ss_fd for this descriptor.
Actually we use ss_fd0 for input and ss_fd1 for output.
These will be the same for a serial port or socket,
and different if we are talking to a software synth through a pipe.
With acs_fd and ss_fd in place, the bridge can perform some functions for you,
like reading from the two file descriptors simultaneously, and watching for events.
We've already seen the acsint events, keystrokes, console switch, etc.
The most common synthesizer events are index markers and speech status.
If I am able to capture these events
they will be passed back to you through handlers,
much like the handlers seen above.

Ask whether the synthesizer is still talking.
If not, then it is ready for more speech.
This is a subtle function, and its implementation may vary with the style.

One thing we can't do is poll ss_fd1,
and ask whether writing would block.
Most units have an on-board buffer and will happily accept
the next sentence while it is in the middle of speaking the current sentence.
And if you're going through a unix pipe, it has an internal buffer
before you get to the child process.
This is not very helpful when it comes to synchronized speech.

The Doubletalk uses RI (ring indicator) to tell us whether it is
actually speaking, and that is perfect if you have low level
access to the uart, as we did when the adapter was in the kernel.
But when working through /dev/ttyS0, you can't get this information.
It's just not available.
So that won't work either.
Besides, that is Doubletalk specific.

You could time it, and say each word takes so many seconds to speak
at the current speech rate.
I've done this before, and it's ugly!
But it's all you have in SS_STYLE_GENERIC.

The last and best solution is index markers.
Attach a marker to each word, and the unit passes that marker back to you
when it is speaking the corresponding word.
I move the reading cursor along as these markers are returned.
Thus the reading cursor is on the words you are hearing.
This is handled for you in acsbridge.c.
In addition these markers tell us whether the unit is still talking.
So whenever index markers are available here is what I'm going to do.
If you send a one time string to the synth, like reading the current character,
or current word, or announcing "louder" as you increase volume,
or any little snippit of text without index markers,
then I'm going to assume it is instantly read,
and the synthesizer is ready for more text.
The theory is that you won't type faster than it can speak these bits of text,
especially if it is speaking fast, which is usually the case.
There is an exception to this rule; if you hold down a key
that reads the next letter or word, and the key repeats,
then you could buzz through your text reading sequential letters or words.
These could collect in the synthesizer's on-board buffer
and it could have 30 seconds of speech,
and we don't even know it.
it could be "still talking",
and yet ss_stillTalking() returns 0.
I'll try to think of a way around this, but meantime
let's just say that small bits of text, without index markers,
are spoken right away.
In contrast, a sentence or phrase or line
should be sent with index markers,
and those markers are used to track the reading cursor
and maintain talking status.
The unit is "still talking" until the penultimate marker is returned.
And that point it is done talking and the adapter can
gather up and transmit the next sentence.

Thus stillTalking() has two purposes:
to tell the adapter when to send the next sentence,
and to tell the adapter that it should interrupt speech on a keystroke.
It doesn't really mean the unit is talking, it means it is talking
*and* speaking a sentence that should be interrupted,
rather than just the last half second of a snippet of text,
which we don't really need to interrupt.

You don't have to wake up every second and call this function;
set up a handler for index markers,
and each time you get an index marker,
ask whether the unit is still talking.
If not, then send out the next sentence.
If I have done everything right,
then everything is event driven, and you don't have to wake up from time to time
and see if there is something to do.
That's my goal.

I will append the cr, to tell the synth to start speking.
But it isn't always a cr.
The dectalk requires control k cr, just to be perverse.
So as always, you need to set the synthesizer style.

The say_char routine looks in the punctuation pronunciation table,
getpunc(), to see if you have specified a pronunciation.
If not, it just sends the character on to the synthesizer.

This is basically a write(2) call.
It will block if the synth is not ready, but it should be ready.
Even if it is still speaking, it probably has a substantial type ahead buffer.
Most of them do.
Thus you cannot use low level flow control to synchronize speech.
That won't work.
You should be watching for status bits or index markers etc.
So let's say you are doing that, and you believe it is ready to speak
the next item - you can send it out here.

You may choose to manipulate this array, as you restructure
the sentence for pronunciation purposes,
but each nonzero entry should still mark the start of a word or entity,
and offsets[29] should still be the location in the buffer,
relative to the reading cursor, of the word that begins at s[29].
Note that offsets[29] need not equal 29.
It probably did at the start, but that could change
as you process the sentence.
Consider the example

On 02/02/2003 I graduated.
offsets[17] = 17, placing an index marker at the word graduated.
You rewrite the sentence as
On february second 2 thousand 3 I graduated.
Now offsets[35] = 17.
If you play by these rules, I will keep the reading cursor
on the word last spoken.
I do this by monitoring index markers coming back from the synthesizer.
So you probably don't have to set imark_h (handler) at all.

The actual markers sent to the synth start with firstmark
and increment from there.
Markers cannot go beyond 99.
